Java EE Concepts
---

A Java Maven project using Arqullian to explore Java EE concepts.

The goal is to provide a smallish framework for exploration and testing of Java EE code without having to dig through piles of specifications.

This project, as was the creator's original intent, suits well for Java EE education making "live coding" a plausible alternative for the teacher.

Each package illustrate a Java EE concept and provide elaborative kickass comments that explain everything of relevance with quotes and references to Java EE specifications and other litterature. The test classes will "prove" what really happens on the inside of a Java EE application server. These tests execute without any hassle right in your IDE.
